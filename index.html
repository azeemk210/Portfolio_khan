          <h1>Automatic detection of rooftop solar PVs from satellite imagery using deep learning </h1>
          <p>In this project, I led the development of an automated system utilizing deep learning techniques to detect
            rooftop
            solar photovoltaic (PV) installations from satellite imagery. The primary objective was to streamline the
            detection
            process for solar PV systems across the expansive Salzburg region, spanning over 7000 square kilometers.
            Through the
            implementation of advanced deep learning algorithms, our system successfully identified and geolocated over
            10,000
            existing PV installations.</p>

          <h1>US Airports on Webmap using leaflet </h1>
          <p>This project utilizes the Leaflet library to create an interactive web map displaying airports across the

            information about the respective airport. The information provided in the popup includes essential data such
            as airport name, location, longitude, and latitude. Users can click on individual markers to access this
            information, enhancing their understanding of airport infrastructure and facilitating travel planning.
            Through the integration of Leaflet's mapping capabilities and dynamic popups, this project offers an

          <p>The project involves creating destination maps using Tableau to visualize flight delays and cancellations
            data from
            the Department of Transportation in the U.S. The process includes connecting to the data, performing data
            wrangling,
            and creating a route by specifying start and end locations. Calculated fields are used to define the route
            order.

            serving as
            detail. Average arrival delay is displayed on the map, and lines connecting origin and destination airports
            are drawn

            <p> Filters are applied to focus on specific airports, and circles representing arrival delay at

              changed to
              black for better contrast.

              The project demonstrates how to analyze flight delays and cancellations data visually, allowing for
              insights into
              airport performance and variability in arrival delay depending on the destination. Destination maps help

          <h1>COVID-19 Trends with ArcGIS Notebooks and ArcPy Charts</h1>
          <p>This notebook showcases the capabilities of ArcPy Charts within ArcGIS Notebooks for visualizing and
            analyzing
            COVID-19 data in the United States during 2020. ArcGIS Pro Charts provide a powerful toolset for uncovering
            patterns,
            trends, and relationships within spatial datasets. By integrating ArcPy Charts into Python workflows, users
            can
            automate data preparation, visualization, and analysis tasks, facilitating spatial data science workflows.

          <h1>Classify land cover to measure shrinking lakes</h1>
          <p> Lake Poyang, China's largest freshwater lake, is experiencing significant shrinkage due to upstream water
            diversion from the Yangtze River at the Three Gorges Dam. This environmental phenomenon poses threats to
            local livelihoods, alters land cover dynamics, and adversely affects the regional economy. </p>

          <details>
            <summary>More Details</summary>
            <p> To provide empirical evidence for advocacy efforts aimed at preserving the lake, this study conducts a
              comparative analysis of satellite imagery from 1984 and 2014. By quantifying the surface area of Lake
              Poyang across the two time periods, this research aims to elucidate the extent of its decline and
              illustrate temporal changes. The findings offer valuable insights into the ecological impact of water
              diversion projects and underscore the urgent need for conservation measures to safeguard Lake Poyang and
              its surrounding communities.</p>

          <h1>Analysis and Design of multi-storey (G+4) building using AutoCAD & Staad Pro</h1>
          <p> This project involves the analysis and design of a multi-storey (G+4) commercial building, employing
            AutoCAD for architectural design and Staad Pro for structural analysis. Beginning with architectural
            planning in AutoCAD, the project progresses to structural analysis using Staad Pro, considering factors like
            seismic forces and wind loads. Detailed design of structural elements follows, ensuring compliance with
            safety standards and material properties. Through this integration of software tools, the project aims to
            deliver a safe and efficient building design for commercial use.</p>

          <h1>Population Distribution Mapping of India Using ArcGIS </h1>
          <p> This project focuses on the creation of a population distribution map of India using ArcGIS, a powerful
            geographic
            information system (GIS) software. Leveraging population data sources such as census data or satellite
            imagery, the
            project aims to visualize and analyze the spatial distribution of population across different regions of
            India. Through
            the utilization of ArcGIS tools and techniques, including data visualization, spatial analysis, and map
            design, the
            project provides insights into population density, demographic trends, and urban-rural dynamics within the
            country.</p>
